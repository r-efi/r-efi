//! UEFI Protocols
//!
//! The UEFI Specification splits most of its non-core parts into separate protocols. They can
//! refer to each other, but their documentation and implementation is split apart. We provide
//! each protocol as a separate module, so it is clearly defined where a symbol belongs to.
