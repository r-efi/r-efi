//! UEFI Reference Specification Protocol Constants and Definitions
//!
//! This project provides protocol constants and definitions as defined in the UEFI Reference
//! Specification. The aim is to provide all these constants as C-ABI compatible imports to rust.
//! Safe rust abstractions over the UEFI API are out of scope of this project. That is, the
//! purpose is really just to extract all the bits and pieces from the specification and provide
//! them as rust types and constants.
//!
//! While we strongly recommend using safe abstractions to interact with UEFI systems, this
//! project serves both as base to write those abstractions, but also as last resort if you have
//! to deal with quirks and peculiarities of UEFI systems directly. Therefore, several examples
//! are included, which show how to interact with UEFI systems from rust. These serve both as
//! documentation for anyone interested in how the system works, but also as base for anyone
//! implementing safe abstractions on top.
//!
//! # Target Configuration
//!
//! Rust code can be compiled natively for UEFI systems. However, you are quite unlikely to have a
//! rust compiler running in an UEFI environment. Therefore, you will most likely want to cross
//! compile your rust code for UEFI systems. To do this, you need a target-configuration for UEFI
//! systems. In case your rust compiler does not provide these, this project has several of them
//! included.
//!
//! A target-configuration tells the rust compiler (and backends) about the formats and rules used
//! on the target architecture. Since UEFI systems borrow most of their definitions from Microsoft
//! Windows, the target-configurations look similar as well.
//!
//! The target configurations can be found in the source-tree under their respective target-triple
//! name. For instance, the `x86_64` configuration is called `x86_64-unknown-uefi.json`. Note that
//! the target-configuration interface is not a stable rustc API. Therefore, it is subject to
//! change. We try to only ever provide configurations for the nightly version of rustc, but work
//! with upstream to make sure suitable target-configurations are included with rustc.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! To write free-standing UEFI applications, you need to disable the entry-point provided by rust
//! and instead provide your own. Most target-configurations look for a function called `efi_main`
//! during linking and set it as entry point. If you use the target-configurations provided with
//! this module, they will pick the function called `efi_main` as entry-point.
//!
//! The following example shows a minimal UEFI application. Note that, depending on your rust
//! compiler, you might need further hooks to make this compile. In particular, you most likely
//! need a panic-handler and compiler-intrinsics as well. See the bundled examples for complete
//! examples compatible to Rust-2018.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #![no_main]
//! #![no_std]
//!
//! use r_efi::efi;
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern fn efi_main(_h: efi::Handle, _st: *mut efi::SystemTable) -> efi::Status {
//!     efi::Status::SUCCESS
//! }
//! ```

// XXX: - We should document why SIMD is disabled in our target-configurations. UEFI generally
//        allows MMX+SSE, but there have been reports that the FP exception handlers are
//        uninitialized. Generally, that is not a problem, unless you trigger FP exceptions. So
//        far we simply disable any SIMD extenions to avoid all this. We should try to
//        investigate, though.
//      - UEFI allows stack-pages to be marked non-executable. So far there is no way to tell
//        rustc about this in the target-configuration. There might be no need for it, if rustc
//        never places code on the stack. However, we did not investigate this. So if rustc places
//        trampolines, or similar constructs, on the stack, this would fail.

// We use globals a lot, since UEFI defines many Guid-globals and other constants. However, we
// want to be able to initialize these globals with proper constructor functions. We thus use the
// `const fn` feature of rust, which is stable through `min_const_fn` since 1.31.0. However, we
// still need `const_int_ops` to make the standard library integer conversion helpers const-safe
// as well.
#![feature(const_int_ops)]

// We want to use the TryFrom trait to convert between the native `char` and our own Char{8,16}
// types. We cannot simply use From, as the conversion is not well-defined at all chars.
#![feature(try_from)]

// Mark this crate as `no_std`. We have no std::* dependencies (and we better don't have them),
// so no reason to require it. This does not mean that you cannot use std::* with UEFI. You have
// to port it to UEFI first, though.
//
// In case of unit-test compilation, we pull in `std` and drop the `no_std` marker. This allows
// basic unit-tests on the compilation host. For integration tests, we have separate compilation
// units, so they will be unaffected by this.
#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]

// Import the different core modules. We separate them into different modules to make it easier to
// work on them and describe what each part implements. This is different to the reference
// implementation, which uses a flat namespace due to its origins in the C language. For
// compatibility, we provide this flat namespace as well. See the `efi` submodule.
#[macro_use]
pub mod base;

pub mod system;

// Import the protocols. Each protocol is separated into its own module, readily imported by the
// meta `protocols` module. Note that this puts all symbols into their respective protocol
// namespace, thus clearly separating them (unlike the UEFI Specification, which more often than
// not violates its own namespacing).
pub mod protocols;

/// Flat EFI Namespace
///
/// The EFI namespace re-exports all symbols in a single, flat namespace. This allows mirroring
/// the entire EFI namespace as given in the specification and makes it easier to refer to them
/// with the same names as the reference C implementation.
///
/// Note that the individual protocols are put into submodules. The specification does this in
/// most parts as well (by prefixing all symbols). This is not true in all cases, as the
/// specification suffers from lack of namespaces in the reference C language. However, we decided
/// to namespace the remaining bits as well, for better consistency throughout the API. This
/// should be self-explanatory in nearly all cases.
